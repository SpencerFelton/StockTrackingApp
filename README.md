* Message Sender API - represents the service provider (Similarly to e.g. Yahoo Finance API) which tracks stock data. 
* RabbitMQ Server - sends update messages between the sender and receiver API's to sync their data.
* Message Receiver API(s) - acts as the Subscriber API, allowing users to view stock data and subscribe to specific stocks via the StockTrackingClient.
* Presentation components - on the provider side, stocks can be added/deleted, modified and have their price changed. On the subscriber side, users can view stocks and their associated price data, as well as subscribe to particular stocks they are interested in.
